                <div class="bodytext"><p>Practice speaking with a qualified teacher and other students about complex topics such as artificial intelligence, politics, education, history, job interviews and more. Learn how to debate a wide range of topics and defend your viewpoints. Master your use of passive voice, conditionals, phrasal verbs and idioms. Receive personalized feedback related to grammar use and pronunciation. The hours are flexible so students with busy schedules can still find time to study. This level is recommended for ages 16 and higher and students should be at least upper-intermediate in English.</p></div>
