                <div class="bodytext1"><p>The young learner's pathway takes a different approach than the adults. This course is suitable for students who are aged 10-16 and already have a decent grasp of English. This includes students who are in the KET or PET levels (pre-IELTS). Our Cambridge based curriculum and assessments ensure standardized and world recognized English education. Aside from following the Cambridge standard we also challenge our students at this level with debate lessons so they can express and defend their viewpoints. You'll also use our interactive e-books to learn new vocabulary and grammar concepts while practicing reading, listening, speaking and writing skills. This will ensure a strong foundation for continuining into IELTS preparation. </p></div>
